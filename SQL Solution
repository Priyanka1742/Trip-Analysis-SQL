1. How many Customers have taken a ride in more than 1 city? (for both completed and incomplete rides)

SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM 
    rides
GROUP BY 
    customer_id
HAVING 
    COUNT(DISTINCT city_name) > 1;


2. What is the average revenue per trip for all completed trips?

SELECT 
    AVG(trip_fare) AS avg_revenue_per_trip
FROM 
    rides
WHERE 
    status = 'completed';


3.Top 5 customers Id with the most number of completed trips

SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    COUNT(*) AS completed_trips
FROM 
    rides
WHERE 
    status = 'completed'
GROUP BY 
    customer_id
ORDER BY 
    completed_trips DESC
LIMIT 5;


4.Give a list of customers who haven't taken a ride since the last 2 weeks

SELECT 
    DISTINCT customer_id
FROM 
    rides
WHERE 
    customer_id NOT IN (
        SELECT 
            customer_id
        FROM 
            rides
        WHERE 
            ride_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 2 WEEK)
    );


5.Generate a percentile distribution of trip_fare

SELECT 
    trip_fare,
    NTILE(100) OVER (ORDER BY trip_fare) AS percentile
FROM 
    rides;
